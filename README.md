# Surfs_Up
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. I will be providing W. Avy the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu which will help determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary of Results
### June Temperature Summary Statistics

### December Temperature Summary Statistics

From the June and December summary statistics, the following major points can be concluded:
    
    1. On average, the temperature in the months of June and December are 75° and 71°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has an average temperature of 4° higher than December.

    2. The lowest temperatures for the months of June and December are 64° and 56°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has a minimum temperature of 8° higher than December.

    3. The highest temperatures for the months of June and December are 85° and 83°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has a maximum temperature of 2° higher than December.

## Summary

Overall, the difference in degrees between these two months in terms of average, maximum and minimum temperature is not significant, with a an average difference of about 4.7°. Therefore, it is safe to indicate that the weather in Oahu is relatively warm and stable throughout the year. Nevertheless, two additional queries have been performed to better support the argument that Oahu will be a good spot to open the surf and ice cream shop.

    ### June Precipitation Summary Statistics

    ### December Precipitation Summary Statistics
    ![december_precipitation_summary_statistics](https://github.com/WTAN241/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/december_precipitation_summary_statistics.PNG)

    According to the summary statistics above:

    1. The month of June has an average of 0.13%, maximum of 4.43%, and minimum of 0%
    2. The month of December has an average of 0.22%, maximum of 6.42%, and minimum of 0%

    The average precipitation in Oahu for the months of June and December are both lower than 1% and seems to be steadily low throughout the year. This information reinforces the proposal that Oahu will be a good spot for the surf and ice cream shop.

2. ### June 2017 Temperature Summary Statistics

   ### December 2016 Temperature Summary Statistics

    To provide more evidence that the weather in Oahu has been historically stable and continues to be so, I have provided the above two summary statistics for the temperature of the most recent June and December periods. According to these images:

    1. The most recent June period was in 2017 and the average temperature was about 77°, which is approximately 2° higher than the average historical temperature
    2. The most recent December period was in 2016 and the average temperature was about 71°, which is approximately 0.1° higher than the average historical temperature

    These analysis show that the most recent temperature in Oahu appears to match historical average, thus, making Oahu a great candidate for a location to open the surf and ice cream shop.

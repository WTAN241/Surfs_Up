# Surfs_Up
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. I will be providing W. Avy the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu which will help to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary of Results

From the June and December summary statistics, the following major points can be concluded:
    
    1. On average, the temperature in the months of June and December are 75° and 71°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has an average temperature of 4° higher than December.

    2. The lowest temperatures for the months of June and Decmeber are 64° and 56°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has a minimum temperature of 8° higher than December.

    3. The highest temperatures for the months of June and Decmeber are 85° and 83°, respectively. Therefore, the month of June has a maximum temperature of 2° higher than December.

## Summary

Overall, the difference in degrees between these two months in terms of average, maximum and minimum temperature is not significant, with a an average difference of about 4.7°. Therefore, it is safe to indicate that the weather in Oahu is relatively warm and stable throughout the year. Nevertheless, two additional queries have been performed to better support the argument that Oahu will be a good spot to open the surf and ice cream shop.
